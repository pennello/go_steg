  <h1>Steganographic Embedding Demo</h1>
  <p>
    This is a simple web GUI for the steganographic embedding
    package <code>steg</code>.

  <p>
    The atom size may be specified as 1, 2, or 3.  The default is 1.
  </p>
  <p>
    Input can be provided either as a URL or as a file upload.  If
    provided as a file upload, the entire file will be buffered into
    memory on the server side.

  <p>
    A carrier can be provided either as a URL or as a file upload.  If
    provided as a file upload, the entire file will be buffered into
    memory on the server side.  If provided, then the input will be
    interpreted as a message to embed within the carrier.  The modified
    output will be returned as the response data.  Steg refers to this
    as "muxing".
  </p>
  <p>
    Sans carrier, the input will be interpreted as a source from which to
    extract steganographically-embedded data.  The extracted data will be
    returned as the response data.
  </p>
  <p>
    An offset may be specified on both read and write.  The idea is to
    avoid overwriting sensitive headers in the carrier data.  Note that
    specifying an offset effectivly reduces the size of the carrier
    available to embed your message.
  </p>
  <p>
    Frequently, the data to be embedded will be less than the capacity
    provided by the carrier.  In this case, on extraction, you'll want
    some way to know not to read more than was embedded.  A mechanism for
    this is provided with the box flag.  This will enable the use of a
    simple size-checking encapsulation format.  If you use it on write,
    you'll want to use it on read as well.  Note that using the box flag
    effectively increases the size of your input data.
